B, C, D, E, F are all the exact same recordings as Ken, this could possibly be optimized a touch for Ryu specifically

A	lp ball, dash x3, nj, fj j.mk
		(requires slightly different timing than on Ken)
		(this recording inconsistently experiences an issue where Oro dashes through Ryu, just reload and try again :))
B	mp ball, dash x2, nj, fj j.mk
C	mp ball, dash x2, fj, nj, j.hk
D	hp ball, step back, whiff s.HP, sjf j.mk	
E	hp ball, whiff 2HP, sjf, djf, j.mk
F	hp ball, whiff 2HP, sjf, delay djf, j.hk
		(hard to get the ball to hit once with HP, maybe 1f?)
