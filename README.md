# oro-unblockable-recordings
You can use these recordings with Grouflon's practice mode and Final Burn Neo to practice escaping various Oro unblockables.

Each folder contains several JSON files, a text file called "notation.txt", and possibly a ".fs" save-state file.

Each JSON file is a different unblockable, and must be loaded into Grouflon individually if you wish to use it.

"Notation.txt" shows Oro's inputs with numpad notation, along with any notes I thought were important about the individual setups.

The Chun, Remy, and Urien folders each contain a setup that requires finicky positioning, so I included a save state you can use to make sure it works. The notation file will tell you which setup the save-state is for.

A few of these don't work consistently. If you experience in issue, just refresh the save state and try it again. It will work eventually. I believe this has something to do with the way Grouflon plays back the files. I made them all as consistent as I could. Setups with this issue are noted in the notation files.

To make use of these files:
1. Download the relevant JSON files for the unblockables you wish to practice against.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your Lua script (usually 3rd_training_lua) -> saved -> recordings
3. Copy the JSON files to the "recordings" folder.
4. Start training mode, and select Oro as the second character.
5. Walk forward until you're touching Oro, and make a save state.
6. Press "start" to open the menu.
7. Navigate to the "Recording" tab.
8. Select "Load slot from file."
9. Press "left" or "right" to scroll through the available files until you find the one you want.
10. Highlight "Load" and press the LP button to load the file.
11. Press "start" to exit the menu.
12. Press "coin" to initiate playback.
13. Try to parry out or whatever you want to do.
14. Reload the save state you made earlier if you want to try again.
